Devcamp is a collaborative coding bootcamp ran every semester by UP CSI. Incoming hackers are taught technical development skills over the course of the semester, and we offer those who finish (or already have experience) real-world projects sponsored by our clients.

On occasion, we hold DevTalks, where students (and sometimes invited industry level speakers) share particular advances or 'tricks' in software development.
